HOW TO BUILD:
------------- 
1.  Run the configure script.  It will setup include/setup.h and the
    Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure

    Type ./configure --help to see different options.  Most people will not
    need to alter these.

2.  [DISCOURAGED] Edit the the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to 
    change various options of how the ircd will operate. Usually the defaults
    are OK.

3.  "make" should build ircd.

4.  "make install" will install the ircd, config converter, and documents
    to the directory set by ./configure

5.  Edit template.conf in your install directory, and move it to "ircd.conf".

6.  Run the binary!  ircd will look in the directory you are executing from
    for an ircd.conf first, then it will look to the directory local to itself.
    You may override these options by specifying a config file using:
    ./ircd -f path/to/ircd.conf


REQUIRED PACKAGES:
------------------
If ./configure script fails, make sure you have the required package install.

For CentOS:
1.  Run the following command to install the development tools:
	sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

2.  Run the following command to install the required packages:
	sudo yum install zlib-devel openssl-devel

For Ubuntu:
1.  Run the following command to update your package list:
	sudo apt-get update

2.  Run the following command to install the required packages:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev


Best of luck!
