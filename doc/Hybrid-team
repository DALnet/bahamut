The hybrid team is a group of ircd coders who were frustrated
with the instability and all-out "dirtiness" of the efnet ircd's
available. "hybrid" is the name for the collective efforts of a group
of people, all of us.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this effort..

We have run the code through "purify", a commercial program designed
to find memory leaks. The code has been mostly prototyped. Profiling has also
been done to catch slow portions of the code. Portions of "crufty" code have
been re-written. We have also looked at making the code as easy to setup
up and run as possible using configure, checking header files etc.
Finally speed enhancements and other enhancements have been made to this ircd. 

That is not to say that there are still not bugs, There are always bugs.
But we have reviewed each others work on this project, and are open
to bug reports.

The following people have contributed blood, sweat, and/or code to
this release of hybrid, in nick alphabetical order.
