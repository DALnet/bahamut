Changes for 1.4.36
- Fix bug that caused bans to be expired ~1 million times on startup
- Remove opers from fdlists that are set -o via SVSMODE
- Only show IPs of unknowns or clients to opers in /trace
- Use OpenSSL instead of GMP for encryption (much cleaner! :)
- Remove non-SSJOIN support
- Allow for a server to detect it is out of synch, and request a 
  channel resynch from an upstream hub
- Fix remote /stats k/K/a bug (it works now :)
- Optimize some sendto() things that are used a lot
- Add usermode +I (server hiding)
  - Fix /whois, /admin, /who, etc to not allow a user to discover which 
    server a +I user is on
- Don't let *MY* opers /kill U: lined things (but pass on kills destined for them already)
- Chatops don't require you to be +gb (now, just +b)
- Various typos fixed
- No longer complain if a user is already on a +i channel, and they /join it
- Use hash tables for very common res functions, which were taking up
  as much as 80% of CPU time in a pooled server
- add a command, /userip, for opers. Works just like /userhost.
- Allow /who +c @#channel +#channel @+#channel for more refined /who listings
- Add a /who flag for opers, +/-t, clients who have been on for more/less than <param> seconds
- Don't let opers get stuck in weird anti-flooding bugs (oper recvq lock bug)
- When an oper deopers, they are returned to the appropriate client class
- Allow opers to /who +l <class> for local clients (class = Y: class)
- Send optimizations for high-volume server connections
- Remove fdlists for lists of clients and instead use linked lists for things:
  - recvq clients, instead of searching through *all* clients
  - listing clients, ditto
- Remove certain things which actually caused poor server operation:
  - HTM - relax sending out when we have high incoming traffic. 
    This actually causes a nasty bursty cycle.
  - busy clients
    This was taking up a great deal of CPU time to save CPU time. Hmm.
- Rewrite the entire base socket engine; now supports kqueue on freebsd.
  - Poll() and select() use persistant states, so these should be twice as fast as well.
  - Stop remapping fds. What's the point?
- /stats w reports fd map (don't use this on a large server! :)
- /stats z is more informative
- Hide the source servers of numerics (mask them with me.name)
- Hide /kill sources in quit messages (still in +s, though) and in messages
  sent to killed client
- Hide split sources in quit messages
- Add a LINKSCONTROL command which allows a services-controlled /links list
- Better server traffic accounting in /stats ? (uses a moving average instead of a plain average)
- Fix a bug in which connecting servers will always remove a key if the channel exists (argh!)
- Correctly propogate cmode +O
- Show more squelched info in /whois to opers
- Be smarter about broken FD_SETSIZE implementations
- Crash if we try to free something twice in the block allocator, produces a useful coredump
  instead of confused opers and an unrelated crash hours later.
- ability to lock /lusers output via services for a dynamic amount of time
- Fix 'ghost channels' where I create a channel but none of the users in it exist to me
- Allow /who +i ip/cidr and /who +I (show IPs only) for opers
- SAJOIN, like SAMODE for joining channels. Joins through all modes, sends a globop.
- Local servers notify the channel of an invite, not the server the invitee is on
- Remove the drone module, replace it with a powerful and generic module system that
  has event-based hooks.
- Streamline some privmsg stuff, fix a few bugs.
- Fix a bug in which an IP ban on 1.2.3.4* wouldn't work.
- Dehybridize some things.
- SVSMODE +T, which sets a "client type" that can be seen in a /who +T <clienttype>
- Don't allow ',' in channel keys
- Fix umode +r/-r notification to clients
- Pretty print some things in /stats ?
- Remove support for non-NOQUIT servers
- Modes sent from servers come from the local server now
- Complain about /who +<flag>, where <flag> isn't valid, instead of sending the entire client list
- Move SQLINES and SGLINES into another hash-based structure for fast lookups
- Add SVSHOLD, which adds a local temp qline for a nick for N seconds, intended to replace
  enforcers in services.
- Make HTM work on outgoing traffic (the part of HTM that limits sending lots of expensive 
  things like /list)
- Don't complain about servers relinking that look 'juped'
  (don't complain if the server that already exists is U: lined, unless I actually have a 
   .conf U: line for it!)
- Compile with GCC3!
- Nicer umode separation, ie what used to come in as *** Notice -- comes in as:
  +d : *** Debug --
  +y : *** Spy --
  +c : *** Client --
- Channel join throttling (cmode +j, but disabled for user changes by default to be compatible with
  pre-1.4.36), defaults to 8 network non-split joins in 4 seconds before saying channel is full.
- Fix the DEBUGMODE pattern string exploit

Changes for 1.4.35
- Source address support on /connect problem fixed
- Squelching added, umode +x or +X (+X is silent squelch), this
  prevents the user from doing certain online tasks such as privmsg.
  Meant to be set by a U: lined server or client using SVSMODE.
- Complete rewrite of the kline/akill/zline system. (s)zlines no longer 
  exist. K: lines set on IP addresses without username portions (or *)
  are treated as Z: lines used to be. CIDR banning is now supported
  in all K: line/akill bans (ie, 204.127.54.112/28).
- +F usermode bypasses ircd's recvq throttling for opers
- Improved handling under high load situations
- Ban munching bug introduced in 1.4.34 is fixed
- /rehash GC now works
- lots of sendto_ops_lev changed to sendto_realops_lev for speed
- Fix a bug where we'd try to target limit messages by a server and
  write to locations of memory that weren't ours :)
- Fix O: flags that just didn't work as advertised
- Moved rejection notices to umode +j (re_j_ection)
- Moved KILL messages from U: lined clients to umode +K (oper only)
- Support for a loadable drone module, compile with --enable-dronemodule, 
  ircd tries to load drone.so from DPATH on startup or on /rehash drones,
  read src/drone.c to view the interface
- /stats t shows more information
- Various code cleanup and readability fixes
- Users and opers will now recieve a different output to '/who ?'.
- When 'HELP_FORWARD_HS' is defined, non-opers /quote help requests
  will be forwarded to HelpServ.

Changes for 1.4.34
- Don't use FD_SETSIZE at all if USE_POLL is defined
- Fixed a server negotiation bug that could break apart the network
  when autoconnects and user connects were done at the same instant
- Fix a bug where PART messages were not sent to 'userB' when 'userA's 
  QUIT message was squelched on more than 1 channel
- Fixed split riding ability left over from hybrid (where a channel
  with a newer TS could 'take over' if it had ops and the older TS channel
  did not)
- Fixed 'topic riding' ability that allowed topics from newer TS'd channels
  to propogate.
- Fixed channel ban desync on netjoin
- all channel modes are now sent with a TS
- Target limiting anti-spam measure installed
- Reject acebot-style drones by default
- Minor fixes to prevent annoying auth error messages
- Minor configuration/installation fixes

-- WARNING --
1.4.34 may cause desynch in net joins if used on a network with newer servers!
This is because the algorithm for determining which channel modes to keep
when servers rejoin has changed. You should upgrade your entire network 
to 1.4.34.
-- WARNING --

- Fixed a netsplit detection bug when a leaf server splits from its hub
  (for no_chanops_when_split)
- Fix for .conf based K: lines (that just didn't work)

Changes for 1.4.31

Changes for 1.4.30
- Updated 'make profile'; now on glibc2 systems, you can kill -USR1 the

  the spreading of exploits

Changes for 1.4.29

- Added support to source from a different local IP address when /connecting
  out to another server; useful for servers which don't want to use the main
  IP in the M: line as the server<->server IP
  - To use: Add :<local IP> to the end of a C: line
  - E.g.: C:192.168.0.1:pass:server.dal.net:7325:10:192.168.10.200
