                  connect to <server_A>.  Global Opers only.

                  When [server_B] is not used, CONNECT trys to connect
                  your server to <server_A>.  Local and Global Opers.

                  When [port] is used, the connection will be attempted
                  to [port].  When [port] is not used, a default will be

                  the server you are on if no [server|nick] is given.

                  All users that use TRACE can see the path to
                  [server|nick] if given and all servers and opers
                  connected, as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.

                  Opers can see unregistered connections on a server
                  with TRACE as well as connection class counts.

  REHASH        - REHASH [server] [option]
                  When no [server] and [option] is given, the server

                  file.

                  When [server] is given and no [option], the server
                  [server] will re-read the ircd.conf file.

                  When [option] without [server] is given, the server
                  you are connected to will perform the [option]
                  specified. When [server] and [option] is given, the
                  server [server] will perform the [option] specified.

                  Note: When using REHASH with [server], the server
                  you are on, the target [server] and all hubs
                  in-between must be running bahamut version 2.0.8
                  and above.

+ KLINE         - KLINE [minutes] <nick|user@host> :[reason]
                  Adds a KLINE which will ban the specified user from

                  message saying he/she is banned with reason [reason]

                  For a temporary KLINE, length of kline is given in
                  minutes as the first parameter i.e.
                  KLINE 10 <nick|user@host> :cool off for 10 minutes

                  For a permanent KLINE, use a length of 0.  Leaving out
                  the length will use a default time of 30 minutes.

+ UNKLINE       - UNKLINE <user@host>
