                  When [port] is used, the connection will be attempted

                  All users that use TRACE can see the path to
                  [server|nick] if given and all servers and opers
                  connected, as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.

                  message saying he/she is banned with reason [reason]

                  For a temporary KLINE, length of kline is given in
                  minutes as the first parameter i.e.
                  KLINE 10 <nick|user@host> :cool off for 10 minutes

                  For a permanent KLINE, use a length of 0.  Leaving out
                  the length will use a default time of 30 minutes.
