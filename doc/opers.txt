                  connect to <server_A>.  Global Opers only.

                  your server to <server_A>.  Local and Global Opers.

                  When [port] is used, the connection will be attempted

                  All users that use TRACE can see the path to
                  [server|nick] if given and all servers and opers
                  connected, as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.

                  Opers can see unregistered connections on a server
                  with TRACE as well as connection class counts.

  REHASH        - REHASH [server] [option]
                  When no [option] is given, ircd will re-read the

                  When no [server] is given, rehash will be performed
                  on the server you issued the rehash command from,
                  otherwise it will rehash from the specified server.

                  When [server] is given, both [server] and the hub(s)
                  in between the server you are on and given [server]
                  must be running bahamut version 2.1.1 or later.

                  message saying he/she is banned with reason [reason]

                  For a temporary KLINE, length of kline is given in
                  minutes as the first parameter i.e.
                  KLINE 10 <nick|user@host> :cool off for 10 minutes

                  For a permanent KLINE, use a length of 0.  Leaving out
                  the length will use a default time of 30 minutes.

+ SAJOIN        - SAJOIN <channel>
                  Allows +a opers to join a channel even if bans or modes

+ USERIP        - USERIP <nick> [...]
                  Works exactly as USERHOST does, but displays the IP
