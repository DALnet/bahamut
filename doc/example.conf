#
# The options for whether a line is needed or not are:
# MANDATORY: you absolutely MUST have this line
# NETWORKED: you must have this line if you are connecting this irc
#            server to any other server (servers can run standalone).
# SUGGESTED: it is highly suggested that you use this line
# OPTIONAL: it's completely up to you whether to define this or not
# DISCOURAGED: you really really should not use this line if at all
#              possible.
# OBSOLETE: an old or out of date line that isn't needed.
#
# MANDATORY lines are absolute *musts*, that is, if you do not have this
# line then your server will not work properly. SUGGESTED lines are
# close-to-mandatory (that is, the server will run without it, but you are
# highly encouraged to use these lines).
#
# Note that "*" in a field indicates an "unused" field.
#
# Lines marked with {DALnet} are required if your server is connecting to
# DALnet
#
# ========================================================================
# NOTE! this entire configuration file is read UPSIDE-DOWN! So if you have
# to put something in a specific order (for example, client-connection
# lines), put them in reverse order!
# ========================================================================
#
#
# M: {MANDATORY} - This line sets the server name, description, and IP
# address to bind to.  If you leave the IP field blank or *, it defaults to 
# all local IP addresses on the machine.
#
#   {M:Line Syntax}
# M:Hostname:IP:Server Description:UNUSED
#
M:server.dal.net:*:East Cost DALnet Server:
#
#
# A: {MANDATORY} - This line provides your administrative information, such as
# contact addresses.  This informationis viewed with /admin <server>.  There 
# is no set information to put in the A:Line, but you are encouraged to put at 
# least a contact address for the person responsible for the server.
#
A:Generic Internet Access:Admin John Doe:jdoe@generic.com
#
#
# Y: {SUGGESTED} - These lines define connection classes, which allow you to
# fine-tune client and server connections.  Clients and servers should be 
# placed in seperate classes, and eachset of servers should have their own 
# class.  You may also wish to seperate clients into seperate classes based 
# on location.
#
# The class numbers are not arbitrary.  In auto-connecting servers, the higher
# number, the higher the auto-connect priority.
#
#   {Y:Line Syntax}
# Y:Class Number:Ping Frequency:Connect Frequency:Maximum Links:SendQ
#
# Ping Frequency - The amount of time (in seconds) that the server will wait
# before dropping the connection with Ping Timeout.
#
# Connect Frequency - The amount of time between attempts to connect to servers
# in that class.  Set this to 0 for client Y:Lines.
#
#
#   {DALnet} - These are the recommended Y:Lines for connecting to DALnet.
# You should have atleast ONE client class, and one oper class as well.
#
# Class 50 - Hub to hub, autoconnect
Y:50:90:600:1:20000000
# Class 51 - Hub to EU hub, autoconnect
Y:51:180:600:1:20000000
# Class 33 - Hub to AS leaf
Y:33:240:0:0:15000000
# Class 32 - Hub to EU leaf
Y:32:180:0:0:15000000
# Class 30 - Hub to US leaf
Y:30:90:0:0:15000000
# Class 10 - for known Operators
Y:10:400:100:100:2000000
# Class 1 - Normal Users
Y:1:400:100:100:1000000
#
#
# I: {MANDATORY} - These lines are client-authorization lines.  Without them,
# clients will be unable to connect to your server.  Wildcards are permitted.
# You may also require a password or port to connect, but are optional.
#
# Ident (RFC 1413) can also be used by placing a @ in the appropriate fields.
#
#   {I:Line Syntax}
# I:IP Address Mask:Password:Domain-Mask:Port:Connection Class
#
# Standard I:Line allowing anybody to connect to the server:
I:*@*::*@*::1
#
# Oper Hostmasking I:Line requiring the user to connect on a specific port (ie.
# 7139), and provide the correct password (ie. $packWitU:opernick:operpass):
I:*@*:oper.$packWitU:*@*:7149:10
#
# Putting NOMATCH in the first field will stop the ircd from matching against
# the IP, and will force it to match against the hostname.
I:NOMATCH::rmiller@glass.toledolink.com::1
#
#
# O: {OPTIONAL} - These lines define IRC Operator access.  A well-configured
# server should not need an operator online.  The ircd configuration can be
# reloaded by issuing a kill -HUP.
#
# If the user issuing the oper command is not coming from the hostname defined,
# the user will receive the error message "No O:Lines for your host".  Ident is
# permitted in the hostname field.  The class field denotes the Y:Line class
# that you want the user to end up in after they've successfully issued the
# /oper command.
#
# Access flags may be left blank, or wildcarded.  Flags are in the form of a
# string.  Any combination of the following can be used:  (CASE SENSITIVE)
#
# r = access to /rehash server
# R = access to /restart server
# D = access to /die server
# g = oper can send /globops
# w = oper can send /wallops
# l = oper can send /locops
# c = access to do local /squits and /connects
# C = access to do remote /squits and /connects
# k = access to do local /kills
# K = access to do global /kills
# b = oper can /kline users from server
# B = oper can /unkline users from server
# n = oper can send local server notices(/notice $servername message)
# N = oper can send global notices(/notice $*.dal.net message)
# A = can set umode +Aa to display server admin access in /whois
# a = can set umode +a to display services admin access in /whois
# u = oper can set /umode +c
# f = oper can set /umode +f
# F = oper can set /umode +F
# s = oper can send /chatops
# o = local oper, flags included: rhgwlckbBnuf
# O = global oper, flags included: oCKNs
#
# Note: the RD flags must be manually included if you wish the
# O:line to give /restart or /die access. They do not appear in
# any wildcard lines, therefore a full set of operflags is OaARD
#
#   {O:Line Syntax}
# O:Hostname:Password:Nickname:AccessFlags:Class
#
O:jdoe@*.generic.com:j0hnsPa$$:john:OaA:10
#
#
# U: {OPTIONAL} - This line defines servers that are allowed to make changes to
# the IRC environment (ie. mode changes), without obstructing them.
#
#   {U:Line Syntax}
# U:Server Name:Unused:Unused
#
#   {DALnet} - The following U:Lines are required to connect to DALnet
U:services.dal.net:*:*
U:stats.dal.net:*:*
#
#
# X: {SUGGESTED} - This line defines the passwords required for an oper to
# /restart or /die the server, in addition to them having the R or D flags in
# their O:Line.
#
#   {X:Line Syntax}
# X:diepass:restartpass
#
#
# C: {NETWORKED} - These lines define what servers your server tries to connect
# to.
#
# N: {NETWORKED} - These lines define what servers are permitted to initiate
# connections to your server.
#
# C/N Lines MUST be used in pairs.  One cannot be used without the other.
#
# Both the C:Line's port field and the N:Line's flag field may be left blank.
# The C:lines' Source Address field may also be left blank
# If a port is specified in the C:Line, your server will auto-connect.
#
# The flags field in the N:Line accepts a combination of the following:
#
# E - Use RC4 streaming compression.
# Z - Use ZLib compression.  It's generally a good idea to compress hub<->hub
# and hub->leaf, but compressing leaf->hub on large client servers is
# discouraged due to higher CPU usage.
#
#   {C/N:Line Syntax}
# C:Remote Hostname:Password:Remote Servername:Port:Source Address
# N:Remote Hostname:Password:Remote Servername:Flags:Class

#
#
# q: {OBSOLETE} - q:lines have been removed from bahamut.

#
#
# H: {OPTIONAL} - These lines define who you allow to act as a hub.  The first
# field may use wildcards, and the third field MUST be an exact match for a
# server's name (NOT the server's hostname!).
#
#   {H:Line Syntax}
# H:Servers which are permitted::Hub Servername
