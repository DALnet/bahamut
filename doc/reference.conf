 * Bahamut IRCd, doc/reference.conf
 *
 * Originally written by Trevor Talbot (Quension) in April 2004.
 * 
 * The configuration format consists of blocks, each containing name-value
 * pairs, tags, or string data.  It is designed to be easily readable by
 * both human and ircd.
 * 
 * A block consists of a block name, an opening '{' brace, statements, a
 * closing '}' brace, and a ';' semicolon.  A statement consists of a
 * name, possibly followed by a value, and ending with a semicolon.
 * Strings that contain special characters or whitespace can be surrounded
 * by '"' double quotes.  All elements of the configuration are separated
 * by whitespace, and can be packed on one line, or broken up over several
 * lines.
 *
 */

# Comments are supported in three forms:
    /* C style
       multi-line */
    # shell style single-line
    // C++ style single-line

/*
 * A sample block:
 * 
 *     block {
 *         name value;            # A statement with a name value
 *         name 123;              # A statement with a number value
 *         name "hello world";    # A statement with a string value
 *         tag;                   # A simple tag
 *         "will code for food";  # A simple string
 *     };
 * 
 * The parser also understands a special include directive outside of a
 * block context:
 * 
 *     include path/to/file.conf;

# Global [REQUIRED]
# The Global block defines information about the server itself.
# This block is required for the server to start.

};

# The DIE and RESTART commands can optionally require passwords to be
# supplied, to help prevent accidents.  If the dpass and rpass tokens are
# not specified, no passwords are needed.
# 
# The Admin block may be nested here.  (This is currently a purely
# organizational/astetic option.  This will probably change in future
# releases.  -epi)
# 
# The server name may only be changed by a server restart.  The info line
# can be changed on rehash, but will not propagate to other linked servers.
# 
# There must be exactly one Global block.

# The services and stats IRC server names are used for the shortform
# commands, which are transformed into targeted name@server messages for
# security.  The services server name is used by SERVICES, IDENTIFY,
# NICKSERV, CHANSERV, MEMOSERV, ROOTSERV, NS, CS, MS, and RS.  The stats
# server name is used by OPERSERV, STATSERV, HELPSERV, OS, SS, and HS.
# >> defaults: services.dal.net, stats.dal.net
# 
# The staff_address token is used for operator hostmasking, as described
# in the Allow block documentation.
# >> default: staff.dalnet
# 
# The nshelpurl token is used to supply a URL for nick registration help.
# It is sent to clients in the rejection numeric when they encounter a +R
# channel and are not registered.
# >> default: http://docs.dal.net/docs/nsemail.html
# 
# The maxchannels token limits the number of channels a user may join at
# one time.  The limit for server operators is 3x this one.
# >> default: 10
# 
# The server type changes some behavior to be appropriate to the role.
# CLIENT servers can only link to one other server (their uplink hub).
# HUB servers link several servers together, but are not intended to hold
# general users.
# >> default: CLIENT
# 
# The server is capable of sending a set of notices to users on connect,
# providing some information about a proxy bot that scans them.  The
# wgmonhost token is the host the bot will be connecting from (for users
# with firewalls or other connection monitoring), and wgmonurl is a web
# page containing additional information about the bot.  If neither token
# is specified, the notices will not be sent.
# 
# Proper clock synchronization is required among connected servers.  This
# requirement can be relaxed by using the ts_warn_delta and ts_max_delta
# tokens.  The TS delta is the difference (in seconds) between the clocks
# of this server and the one it is linked to.  These options should only
# be used as a last resort; the correct fix for TS delta problems is to
# synchronize the clocks on both server computers, such as with the ntpdate
# tool.  Unsynchronized clocks may cause unpredictable network problems.
# >> defaults: 15, 120
# 
# The local_clones and global_clones tokens control the maximum number of
# connections the server will allow from the same place by default.  The
# first number refers connections from the same IP (10.0.0.5).  This number
# may optionally be followed by a colon ':' and a second number, which
# refers to connections from the same site (10.0.0.*).  The local_clones
# token sets the default limits for connections on this server only, and
# may be overridden by the maxclones token in a Class block.  The
# global_clones token sets the default limits for connections as seen on
# the entire network, and may be overridden by network services.
# >> defaults: 10:60, 25:150
# 
# The crypt_oper_pass token configures the server to use hashed passwords
# in the Oper blocks, to avoid password discovery by someone reading the
# conf file.  If this token is specified, passwords in the Oper blocks
# must be generated by the tools/mkpasswd utility.
# 
# The short_motd token enables use of the ircd.smotd file, which is sent
# to clients on connect instead of ircd.motd.  The MOTD command still sends
# the contents of ircd.motd as normal.  This option is intended to reduce
# traffic on connect, but still convince users to read the full motd when
# appropriate.
# 
# The show_links token causes the LINKS command to display real server
# links (though Super servers are still hidden).  If this token is not
# specified, LINKS will display the list given to it by services.
# 
# The allow_split_ops token causes the server to always give chanop status
# to users who join empty channels, even when no other servers are linked.
# Normally op status will not be given when this server is alone, to help
# prevent channel abuse during netsplits.  This token should be used if
# your server is not part of a network.  Opers are always given op status
# in empty channels regardless of this setting.
# 
# All of these tokens are optional, and can be specified at different times
# in multiple Options blocks.  If a token is specified twice, the second
# value overrides the first.

###########################################################################
# Port [REQUIRED]
# The Port blocks define where the server will accept connections.  At
# least one Port block is required to start.
# 
# Old conf format equivalents:
#     M::bind::port
#     P:ipmask:bind::port

port {
    // required tokens
    port    6667;       # Port to listen on

    // optional tokens
    bind    127.0.0.1;  # IP address to listen on
    ipmask  127.0.*.*;  # Mask to accept connections from
    flags   S;		# Allow SSL connections on this port
};

# If a bind address is not specified, the server listens on all available
# interfaces.
#
# Flags available inside port blocks:
#	S  - allow SSL connections on this port
#	n  - do not perform DNS lookups on incoming connections on this port
#	i  - do not perform ident checks on incoming connections on this port
# 
# The ipmask token is used to limit the port to connections from the
# specified IP mask.  Only a simple mask is supported, consisting of a *
# where one component of the address is (e.g. "192.168.*.*").
# 
# There may be multiple Port blocks.

###########################################################################
# Class [RECOMMENDED]
# The Class blocks define the connection classes used by the Allow, Oper,
# and Connect blocks.  While the server will start without a Class block,
# it will not be usable.
# 
# Old conf format equivalents:
#     Y:name:pingfreq::maxusers:maxsendq            (for clients)
#     Y:name:pingfreq:connfreq:maxlinks:maxsendq    (for servers)

class {
    // required tokens
    name        users;      # Name of the class
    pingfreq    90;         # PING idle connection every N seconds
    maxsendq    100000;     # Send buffer limit

    // optional, for Allow classes only:
    maxusers    100;        # Maximum number of clients
    maxclones   2:20;       # Maximum IP:site clones
    maxrecvq    2560;       # client excess flood threshold

    // optional, for Connect classes only:
    connfreq    300;        # Try autoconnect every N seconds
    maxlinks    1;          # Autoconnect if less than N links in class
};

# Idle connections are polled with the PING command every pingfreq seconds.
# 
# The maxsendq token controls the size of the internal send buffer, used
# when a connection cannot accept large amounts of data at once.  Certain
# server commands emit such large amounts of data.  As an example metric,
# a 100KB user send queue can support a WHO <channel> query for a channel
# with approximately 700 users.  Large amounts of data are also generated
# when two servers link and synchronize network state.  If the send queue
# limit is exceeded, the connection is terminated.
# 
# For classes used in the Allow blocks, the maxusers token limits the
# number of clients that may exist in this class.  This is the most common
# general user limit for the server.  If this limit is reached, additional
# clients will be rejected with a "server busy" message.  This token must
# not be specified for classes used in the Connect blocks.
# 
# For classes used in the Allow blocks, the maxclones token limits the
# number of clients that may connect from the same place in this class.
# The first number refers to connections from the same IP (10.0.0.5); it
# may be optionally followed by a colon ':' and a second number, which
# refers to connections from the same site (10.0.0.*).  If this limit is
# reached, clients will be rejected with a "too many connections from your
# host/site" message.  Limits defined here override the defaults as
# configured in the Options block.  If a site limit is not supplied here,
# clients in this class will effectively have no site limit; the default
# limit will not be used.  This token must not be specified for classes
# used in the Connect blocks.
# 
# For classes used in the Connect blocks, the connfreq token specifies the
# frequency at which autoconnections are tried.  This token works together
# with maxlinks, which specifies the maximum number of servers in this
# class to autoconnect to.  For an autoconnection to take place, the
# Connect block must have a valid port token, and there must be less than
# maxlinks connected servers in this class.  The connfreq and maxlinks
# tokens must not be specified for classes used in the Allow or Oper
# blocks.
# 
# A "default" class is created internally using definitions in config.h.
# This class is used when no other class is specified, but its settings are
# not useful for most situations.  Custom classes are strongly suggested.
# 
# There may be multiple Class blocks; at least one is recommended.

###########################################################################
# Allow [RECOMMENDED]
# The Allow blocks define the hosts connections are allowed from, and
# places them into classes.  While the server will start without an Allow
# block, it will not be usable.
# 
# Old conf format equivalents:
#     I:ipmask:passwd:host:port:class

allow {
    // required tokens
    host        *;          # Resolved host mask (optional if using ipmask)
    ipmask      *;          # Unresolved IP mask (optional if using host)
    
    // optional tokens
    port        6667;       # Apply block to this port only
    passwd      secret;     # Require password for connection
    flags       mCFT;       # Special flags for this connection
    class       users;      # Place connections in this class
};

# The server uses a default-deny policy for incoming connections; at least
# one Allow block must be supplied if you wish to use your server.
# 
# The host and ipmask tokens specify which connections this block matches.
# The server always performs DNS and ident lookups for connections.  If DNS
# cannot find a hostname, the IP is used instead.  If ident cannot get a
# valid response, "unknown" is used during this stage.  The client's
# resolved hostname, IP address, ident reply, and username (from the USER
# line) are used according to the results of the matches described below.
# 
# The host token attempts to match first against the resolved hostname if
# available, then against the IP address.  To include the connection's
# ident response in the match, use a mask in the form "ident@host".  If a
# client matches this token, it appears on IRC using its resolved hostname.
# 
# The ipmask token attempts to match against the IP address only.  To
# include the connection's ident response in the match, use a mask in the
# form "ident@host".  If a client matches this token, it appears on IRC
# using its IP address, even if its hostname was resolved.
# 
# If the matching mask used ident ("ident@host" instead of "host"), and no
# ident response was received from the client, it appears on IRC with its
# username prefixed with '~'.  If the matching mask used only the "host"
# form, the client's username is not prefixed.  If a valid ident response
# was received, it is always used (without prefix), regardless of the mask
# form.
# 
# Only one of the host and ipmask tokens is needed; if both are used, host
# is matched first.  For typical configurations, using only the host token
# with a "*@host" or "ident@host" mask is recommended.
# 
# Examples:
#     // client with username "user", ident "ident", hostname "name"
#     host ident@*;     # appears as ident@name
#     ipmask *;         # appears as ident@10.0.0.1
# 
#     // same client without ident response
#     host *;           # appears as user@name
#     host *@*;         # appears as ~user@name
#     ipmask unknown@*; # appears as ~user@10.0.0.1
# 
# The port token limits this block to match connections to the specified
# port only.
# 
# The passwd token requires that matching connections supply a password to
# use the server.  Clients can send a password string in multiple forms,
# depending on which passwords need to be used.  The basic format is:
# 
#     [passwd][:][opername:operpass][:][nickpass]
# 
# If the Allow block requires a password, it must be supplied at the front
# of the string.  If operator hostmasking is enabled (via the flags token
# described below), the client can mask itself by supplying a "name:passwd"
# string as defined in an Oper block.  When masked, a client appears on IRC
# using the Oper block name for its ident, and the Options block
# staff_address for its hostname.  Any remaining passwords are sent to
# NickServ in an SIDENTIFY command.  All password components must be
# separated from each other by a ':' colon.
# 
# Using the examples in this file, a client could connect with the password
# string "secret:johndoe:secret" and be masked as johndoe@staff.net.
# 
# The flags token allows special behavior to be assigned to this
# connection, using a set of single-letter options.  The available flags
# are:
# 
#     m  Enable operator hostmasking
#     C  Bypass clone limiting
#     F  Force umode +F to bypass message flood checks
#     T  Disable rapid (re)connection throttling
# 
# When operator hostmasking is enabled, a matching client can connect using
# a special password to be masked, as described for the passwd token above.
# 
# Normally all clients are subjected to a clone limit check when they
# connect, as configured in the Options and Class blocks.  The C flag skips
# this check for matching clients, allowing them to have an unrestricted
# number of connections.
# 
# The F flag forces matching clients to always have usermode +F, to avoid
# various message flood checks.  This flag is intended for special bots and
# should not be used for server operators; opers can make use of the F
# access flag as described in the Oper block documentation.
# 
# By default, the server throttles rapid (re)connections from a single IP
# address, to help reduce abuse and load.  The T flag disables this
# mechanism for matching clients.  To qualify, a client must send valid
# NICK and USER messages to register the connection, and stay connected
# long enough to complete the ident and DNS lookups.  However, a correct
# password is not required.
#
# The class token specifies the connection Class to place matching
# connections in.  If not specified, the default class is used; see the
# Class block description for details.
# 
# There may be multiple Allow blocks; they are matched in the order they
# appear.

# Oper [SUGGESTED]
# The Oper blocks define server operators.  One or more of these blocks
# is recommended if you intend to maintain your server.

    access  *Aa;            # Access flags

    // optional tokens
    class   opers;          # Place authenticated client in this class
};

# The name and passwd tokens match the parameters of the OPER command.  If
# the crypt_oper_pass token is specified in the Options block, the passwd
# string must be generated by the tools/mkpasswd utility.  The plaintext
# password is still used in the OPER command.
# 
# To authenticate as an operator, a client must match one of the host
# tokens specified in "user@host" mask form.  There can be up to 32 host
# tokens.  The host part is matched against both resolved hostname and IP
# address.
# 
# The access token specifies what access an operator has, using a set of
# single-letter flags.  The available flags are:
# 
#     *  Includes all flags
# 
#     O  Network operator, includes these flags:
#        C  Can route other servers
#        K  Can kill clients on other servers
#        N  Can send global notices
#        and all flags included by 'o' (server operator)
# 
#     a  Can use umode +a (services administrator)
#     F  Can use umode +F (no flood limits)
# 
#     Using any of the flags above will set umode +o (global operator).
#     All other flags set umode +O (local operator) by default.
# 
#     o  Server operator, includes these flags:
#        r  Can use REHASH
#        h  Can use GLOBOPS

# Restrict [OPTIONAL]
# The Restrict blocks disallow nicknames, channelnames, or clients with
# specific GCOS (real name) fields.
# 
# Old conf format equivalents:
#     Q::reason:mask    (NICK, CHAN)
#     G::reason:mask    (GCOS)

restrict {
    // required tokens
    type    chan;           # Type of restriction: NICK, CHAN, GCOS
    mask    "#botworld";    # Disallowed mask
    
    // optional tokens
    reason  "evil bots";    # Reason for restriction
};

# Setting the type token to "nick" will create a nickname restriction,
# using the specified wildcard mask.  Restricted nicknames cannot be used
# by normal clients, but network operators may use them.
# 
# Setting the type token to "chan" will create a channel restriction,
# using the specified wildcard mask.  Restricted channels cannot be used
# by normal clients, but network operators may join them.
# 
# Setting the type token to "gcos" will create a real name field ban,
# using the specified wildcard mask.  Clients with a matching real name
# field will not be permitted to connect.
# 
# The reason token provides a single-line reason for the restriction, and
# is sent to clients along with the rejection notice.
# 
# There may be multiple Restrict blocks.

# Kill [OPTIONAL]
# The Kill blocks disallow connections from clients based on specific
# ident and host masks.
# 
# Old conf format equivalents:
#     K:host:reason:username    (mask was split)

kill {
    // required tokens
    mask    "*@192.168.0.0/24";     # Disallowed mask (wildcard or CIDR)
    
    // optional tokens
    reason  "tourists only!";       # Reason for ban
};

# Kill blocks are a flexible general client ban mechanism.  The mask token
# can be specified in several formats:
# 
#     mask *.bot.world;       # Wildcard hostname
#     mask user@*.isp;        # Wildcard user@hostname
#     mask 192.168.0.0/16;    # CIDR IP (all 4 parts needed)
#     mask user@10.4.2.2/30;  # CIDR user@IP
# 
# CIDR format is the most efficient, and should be used when possible.  The
# server will attempt to convert wildcard IP masks to CIDR form internally.
# 
# Clients that match a Kill block will be rejected from the server.
# Existing clients will be scanned for possible matches when new blocks are
# loaded during rehash.
# 
# There may be multiple Kill blocks.

###########################################################################
# Modules [OPTIONAL]
# The Modules block configures dynamic module loading.
# 
# Old conf format equivalents:
#     modules.ini

modules {
    // optional tokens
    path        mods;   # Directory to look for modules in
    autoload    mod1;   # Module to load at startup
    autoload    mod2;   # Up to 128 modules can be specified here
};

# The path token specifies the directory to search for modules in, relative
# to the ircd directory.  There can only be one path, and the default is
# "modules".
# 
# The autoload token specifies the name of a module (without file
# extension) to load automatically at startup.  There can be up to 128
# autoload tokens.
# 
# There may be only one Modules block.
